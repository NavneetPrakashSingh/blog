Incase you deploy your site to server and ajax POST request gets redirected to GET requests, just have a look at your htaccess file, and check if there is a trailing slash '/' after RewriteRule. Put '/' after /$ and /1. One reason is when you choose a post request and there is no trailing slash, it assumes its a get request and gives error like 503 method not found error, so to avoid that we put a trailing slash after it.
